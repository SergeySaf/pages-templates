# What is biodiversity?

Biodiversity is the term used to describe the variety of life on Earth. It includes every plant and animal as well as micro-organisms such as bacteria and viruses. So far scientists have identified fewer than 2 million species, but they estimate there could be at least 13 million species in total on Earth.

Our lives are intertwined with nature. Plants and animals provide our food, drink, clothing, building materials, fuel and medicines. Living systems also supply other services we take for granted - clean air, fresh water, fertile soil, the breakdown of natural waste, plant pollination and the regulation of our climate.

Biodiversity is all around us; it shapes and enriches our way of life. However, this rich diversity is now being lost at a greatly accelerated rate because of human activities. This loss impoverishes us all and weakens the ability of the living systems on which we depend to resist growing environmental threats.

The threats to species and ecosystems include habitat destruction, over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution, the introduction of alien species, climate change and the increasing demands placed on nature due to rising human populations.

We need to act now to halt the current loss of biodiversity and to ensure a quality of life for future generations.
