## Bonobos

![](../../assets/images/bonobo1.jpg)

Bonobos were identified as a distinct species from [chimpanzees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzees) (Pan troglodytes) in 1933\. Bonobos have also been referred to as gracile or pygmy chimpanzees, but these terms are less commonly used today. The name bonobo is probably derived from a mis-spelling of a village in the Congo called Bolobo.
